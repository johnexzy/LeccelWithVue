            Media use cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in a
            computer system via an Internet browser. Many Internet sites and
            servers make use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie
            ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It made up of
            a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be
            assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was
            stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to
            differentiate the individual browser of the dats subject from other
            Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet
            browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.
            Through the use of cookies, Leccel.net can provide the users of this
            website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible

            Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our website
            users. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for
            users to utilize our website. The website user that uses cookies,
            example, Does not have to enter access data each time the website is
            accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie
            is thus stored on the user's computer system. The data subject may,
            at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by
            means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and
            may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore,
            already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet
            browser or other software programs. This is possible in all popular
            Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of
            cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our
            website may be entirely usable. THIRD PARTY Leccel Media may contain
